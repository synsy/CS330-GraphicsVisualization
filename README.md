# CS330-GraphicsVisualization

Throughout this project, I approached software design by first breaking down the client's reference image into simple geometric components and visual elements. My design philosophy focused on modularity, simplicity, and clarity, ensuring that each part of the system—whether a shape, a material, or a light—was isolated in function but cohesive in execution. Working on this 3D scene helped me develop new design skills, particularly in spatial reasoning and texture planning. I learned how to mentally translate 2D imagery into low-polygon 3D objects, which sharpened my ability to visualize depth, perspective, and lighting in real-time applications. My design process began with analyzing the image, identifying primitive shapes, and then planning object construction using transformations and mesh reuse. This structured approach to scene composition can be applied to any future 3D visualization or game development task, where breaking down complex visuals into manageable, modular components is essential.

When developing the program, I used an iterative approach that began with setting up basic meshes and camera control. From there, I gradually layered in textures, materials, and lighting, constantly testing the scene after each addition. This incremental strategy allowed me to troubleshoot more efficiently and refine visual fidelity without overwhelming the codebase. One key development tactic I adopted was creating reusable functions for transformations, lighting, and shader setup, which significantly improved code readability and maintainability. Iteration played a central role in the project’s success—I revisited object placement, UV scaling, and camera behavior several times to refine the scene to closely match the original reference. Over the course of the project, my coding style evolved to reflect best practices, including modular logic, meaningful comments, and consistent formatting. These improvements helped ensure that the final codebase was professional, polished, and easy to maintain or extend.

Computer science as a discipline plays a significant role in helping me reach my long-term goals by equipping me with both problem-solving frameworks and practical tools. Working with computational graphics and OpenGL has given me valuable experience in real-time rendering, object-oriented design, and matrix transformations. These are foundational concepts not only for game development and simulation but also for fields like virtual reality, 3D printing, and computer vision. Educationally, this project helped solidify my understanding of 3D math and shader programming, which are transferable to more advanced courses in computer graphics and software engineering. Professionally, the skills I’ve developed in this project—such as texture mapping, lighting setup using the Phong model, and virtual camera control—are applicable in industries like gaming, architectural visualization, and digital prototyping. Overall, this project was both a creative and technical challenge that helped me grow as a developer and a designer.
